# LGM_VIP_Oct2021
This is the task 1 of Lets Grow More Virtual Internship Program October 2021.
The task was to create a single page website using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 
So, I have designed a single page website for a pre-primary school.
This includes Home, About, Teachers, Course and Contact us page.
